In the context of a machine learning model, "features" typically refer to the input variables or 
attributes that the model uses to make predictions. In your example, the "features" array is:


"features": [5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]
Here, each number in the array represents a specific feature. Based on the values you provided, 
these could be measurements related to an iris flower, which is a common scenario 
when working with the Iris dataset. Specifically, these values could represent the sepal length, 
sepal width, petal length, and petal width of a flower, respectively.

When you send this array as input to your machine learning model, the model uses its learned 
patterns from the training data to make a prediction. In your case, the response you received was:


{"prediction": 0}
This indicates that the model predicts a class label of 0 for the given set of features. 
In classification tasks, the class labels are typically integers corresponding to different 
categories or classes. In the context of the Iris dataset, class 0 might represent a specific 
species of iris.

To interpret this result, you'd need to refer to the mapping between class labels and actual 
categories. In the Iris dataset, the class labels correspond to three species: 0 (setosa), 
1 (versicolor), and 2 (virginica). So, a prediction of 0 means that the model predicts the 
input features belong to the setosa species.

In summary, your machine learning model predicted that the input features, which likely represent
 measurements of an iris flower, belong to the setosa species based on its learned patterns from 
the training data.
